# Branching Strategy
## Main Branches
- main: This is the production-ready branch. All final code should be merged here.
- develop: This is the integration branch for ongoing development. New features and bug fixes should be merged into this branch.
## Feature Branches
- feature/<feature-name>: Create a new branch from develop for each new feature. Once the feature is complete and tested, merge it back into develop.
## Bugfix Branches
- bugfix/<bugfix-name>: Create a new branch from develop for each bug fix. Once the bug fix is complete and tested, merge it back into develop.
## Release Branches
- release/<version-number>: Create a new branch from develop when preparing for a new release. Once the release is ready, merge it into both main and develop.
## Hotfix Branches
- hotfix/<hotfix-name>: Create a new branch from main for urgent fixes that need to go into production immediately. Once the hotfix is complete and tested, merge it into both main and develop.
## Rules
- Commit Messages: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add login feature" instead of "Added login feature").
- Pull Requests: Always create pull requests for merging branches. Ensure that pull requests are reviewed by at least one other developer.
- Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews to maintain code quality. Provide constructive feedback and ensure that all comments are addressed.
- Testing: Write tests for new features and bug fixes. Ensure that all tests pass before merging branches.
- Documentation: Update documentation as necessary when making changes to the codebase.
- Branch Naming: Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., feature/login-page, bugfix/header-issue).
- Rebasing: Rebase feature branches regularly to keep them up-to-date with the latest changes in develop.
- Merging: Use fast-forward or squash merging to keep the commit history clean.
## Workflow
- Creating a Feature Branch

1. Branch off from develop.
1. Name the branch feature/<feature-name>.
1. Implement the feature.
1. Write tests and ensure they pass.
1. Create a pull request to merge into develop.
1. Address any feedback from code reviews.
1. Merge the feature branch into develop.

- Creating a Bugfix Branch

1. Branch off from develop.
1. Name the branch bugfix/<bugfix-name>.
1. Fix the bug.
1. Write tests and ensure they pass.
1. Create a pull request to merge into develop.
1. Address any feedback from code reviews.
1. Merge the bugfix branch into develop.

- Creating a Release Branch

1. Branch off from develop.
1. Name the branch release/<version-number>.
1. Prepare the release (e.g., update version number, documentation).
1. Ensure all tests pass.
1. Create a pull request to merge into both main and develop.
1. Address any feedback from code reviews.
1. Merge the release branch into both main and develop.

- Creating a Hotfix Branch

1. Branch off from main.
1. Name the branch hotfix/<hotfix-name>.
1. Implement the hotfix.
1. Write tests and ensure they pass.
1. Create a pull request to merge into both main and develop.
1. Address any feedback from code reviews.
1. Merge the hotfix branch into both main and develop.
