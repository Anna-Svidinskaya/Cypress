Branching Strategy
Main Branches
main: This is the production-ready branch. All final code should be merged here.
develop: This is the integration branch for ongoing development. New features and bug fixes should be merged into this branch.
Feature Branches
feature/<feature-name>: Create a new branch from develop for each new feature. Once the feature is complete and tested, merge it back into develop.
Bugfix Branches
bugfix/<bugfix-name>: Create a new branch from develop for each bug fix. Once the bug fix is complete and tested, merge it back into develop.
Release Branches
release/<version-number>: Create a new branch from develop when preparing for a new release. Once the release is ready, merge it into both main and develop.
Hotfix Branches
hotfix/<hotfix-name>: Create a new branch from main for urgent fixes that need to go into production immediately. Once the hotfix is complete and tested, merge it into both main and develop.
Rules
Commit Messages: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add login feature" instead of "Added login feature").
Pull Requests: Always create pull requests for merging branches. Ensure that pull requests are reviewed by at least one other developer.
Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews to maintain code quality. Provide constructive feedback and ensure that all comments are addressed.
Testing: Write tests for new features and bug fixes. Ensure that all tests pass before merging branches.
Documentation: Update documentation as necessary when making changes to the codebase.
Branch Naming: Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., feature/login-page, bugfix/header-issue).
Rebasing: Rebase feature branches regularly to keep them up-to-date with the latest changes in develop.
Merging: Use fast-forward or squash merging to keep the commit history clean.
Workflow
Creating a Feature Branch

Branch off from develop.
Name the branch feature/<feature-name>.
Implement the feature.
Write tests and ensure they pass.
Create a pull request to merge into develop.
Address any feedback from code reviews.
Merge the feature branch into develop.
Creating a Bugfix Branch

Branch off from develop.
Name the branch bugfix/<bugfix-name>.
Fix the bug.
Write tests and ensure they pass.
Create a pull request to merge into develop.
Address any feedback from code reviews.
Merge the bugfix branch into develop.
Creating a Release Branch

Branch off from develop.
Name the branch release/<version-number>.
Prepare the release (e.g., update version number, documentation).
Ensure all tests pass.
Create a pull request to merge into both main and develop.
Address any feedback from code reviews.
Merge the release branch into both main and develop.
Creating a Hotfix Branch

Branch off from main.
Name the branch hotfix/<hotfix-name>.
Implement the hotfix.
Write tests and ensure they pass.
Create a pull request to merge into both main and develop.
Address any feedback from code reviews.
Merge the hotfix branch into both main and develop.
